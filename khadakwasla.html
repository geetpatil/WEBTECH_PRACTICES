		<b>History of Khadakwasla Dam
Khadakwasla Dam Pune was built in the 19th century. It was planned by Captain Fife Re of the British army after a severe drought hit East Pune. He was also involved in the construction of the dam. That’s why the lake here was called Fife Lake until 1947.

Under Captain Fife Re, the construction of Khadakwasla Dam started in 1869. And the dam was completed in 1879.

The original dam, however, was destroyed in 1961 because of floods. But to take care of the ongoing water crisis, the dam was rebuilt soon after.
