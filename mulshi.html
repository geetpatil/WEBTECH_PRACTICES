			Mulshi is the name of a major dam on the Mula river in India.[1] It is located in the Mulshi taluka administrative division of the Pune district of Maharashtra State.

Water from the dam is used for irrigation as well as for generating electricity at the Bhira hydroelectric power plant, operated by Tata Power. The station operates six 25MW Pelton turbines installed in 1927 and one 150MW Pumped Storage Unit. Water from this reservoir located in the Krishna river basin is diverted to the Bhira power house for generating Hydro electricity.

In 1920â€“21, during the construction of the dam and power station, Pandurang Mahadev Bapat led Mulshi Satyagrah, a movement to represent farmers whose land had been taken to build the project. He was dubbed Senapati (commander) in recognition of his leadership.
