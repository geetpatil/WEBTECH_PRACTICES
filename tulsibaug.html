		<b>This palace was built in 1892 by Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah Agakhan III. He was elected as the President of the League of Nations in 1938 and was well renowned in the field of politics and sports. The palace was later donated to India by Aga Khan IV in 1969 as a mark of respect to Gandhiji and his philosophy.

		Historical importance:
		The Agakhan Palace Pune is a national monument of India's freedom movement. Following the launch of Quit India movement in 1942, Gandhiji, his wife Kasturba, his secretary Mahadevbhai Desai were interned at the palace from August 9, 1942 to May 6, 1944. Mahadevbhai and Kasturba passed away while in captivity at the Agakhan palace and their samadhis are located in the campus. Situated near the River Mula, the palace is a simple memorial to Gandhi and his life.
